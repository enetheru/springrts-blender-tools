Issues
* test for valid UV Map
  Create one using any method if it doesnt exist.
* Invert UV map on export and restore
* FIX Height Radius and Midpoint Cals for ./objects3d/object.lua
* Solve texture selection and saving issue
  This one can be solved by using normal textures and then using the
  compositor to split and merge them to the required output.

further TODO
* Create Dynamic Colission Volume tools
  The vision is that you will turn on the visual and be able to edit
  it as a 3d object in the 3d view automatically updating the values
  in the scene properties
* Create footprint visualiser
  will show a quad that resizes controlled by the values in the scene
  properties.
