= Issues/ToDo =
== Test for UV Map==
Create one using any method if it doesnt exist.
== Check before clobber ==
Try not to overwrite files without checking first
== Manual texture image work==
* remove the need to edit the text files after export.
* write image conversion using imagemagick into the python so that work can be done purely in blender.
== Error when attempting to use auto functions with no root node defined ==
need to make this much cleaner
== Copy occlusion volume to Collision Volume button ==

= Notes =
== UV Invert ==
The UV Coordinates used in spring are inverted on the Y axis compared
to blender, You have two options to resolve the difference, invert the
UV Coords before exporting, or invert the images. My preference is to
invert the images as they require processing to get the channels in
the right order.
I have a composite node setup to do all the required operations,
or I have a shell script using imagemagick.
I want to put it into the blender interface though so python.

== Conversion to and from coordinate space ==
from Blender's XYZ -> spring needs to use (X)(Z)(-Y)
from Spring's XYZ -> blender needs to use (X)(-Z)(Y)
The Custom properties are defined in Spring's Coordinates, so that
transferring to text will make more sense.
