== UV Invert ==
The UV Coordinates used in spring are inverted on the Y axis compared
to blender, You have two options to resolve the difference, invert the
UV Coords before exporting, or invert the images. My preference is to
invert the images as they require processing to get the channels in
the right order.
I have a composite node setup to do all the required operations,
or I have a shell script using imagemagick.
I want to put it into the blender interface though so python.

== Conversion to and from coordinate space ==
from Blender's XYZ -> spring needs to use (X)(Z)(-Y)
from Spring's XYZ -> blender needs to use (X)(-Z)(Y)
The Custom properties are defined in Spring's Coordinates, so that
transferring to text will make more sense.
